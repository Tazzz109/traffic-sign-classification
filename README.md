# traffic-sign-classification
This project uses a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signals into 43 categories, enhancing road safety and supporting autonomous vehicles. Built with TensorFlow and deployed via Streamlit, it preprocesses images for real-time predictions, contributing to intelligent transportation systems and AI-driven traffic management.
